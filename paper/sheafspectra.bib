Abramsky and Brandenburger used sheaf theory to give a general treatment of contextuality in quantum theory [New Journal of Physics 13 (2011) 113036]. However, contextual phenomena are found in other fields as well, for example database theory. In this paper, we shall develop this unified view of contextuality. We provide two main contributions: firstly, we expose a remarkable connection between contexuality and logical paradoxes; secondly, we show that an important class of contextuality arguments has a topological origin. More specifically, we show that "All-vs-Nothing" proofs of contextuality are witnessed by cohomological obstructions.},

Moreover, we conduct analyses on convergence characteristics in terms of locations of eigenvalues. Additionally, we study consensus conditions when the biased alignments are time-varying with errors in measured distances. Finally, several extensions of the problem on complete graphs, double-integrator dynamics, and three-dimensional space are also provided.},

A particularly advantageous way to study these systems is through the analysis of the networks that encode the interactions among the system's constituents. During the last two decades, network science has provided many insights in natural, social, biological and technological systems. However, real systems are more often than not interconnected, with many interdependencies that are not properly captured by single layer networks. To account for this source of complexity, a more general framework, in which different networks evolve or interact with each other, is needed. These are known as multilayer networks. Here we provide an overview of the basic methodology used to describe multilayer systems as well as of some representative dynamical processes that take place on top of them. We round off the review with a summary of several applications in diverse fields of science.},

The process of opinion forming on such a community is most often highly predictable, with polarized opinions reflecting the bipartition of the network. The aim of this paper is to suggest a class of dynamical systems, called monotone systems, as natural models for the dynamics of opinion forming on structurally balanced social networks. The high predictability of the outcome of a decision process is explained in terms of the order-preserving character of the solutions of this class of dynamical systems. If we represent a social network as a signed graph in which individuals are the nodes and the signs of the edges represent friendly or hostile relationships, then the property of structural balance corresponds to the social community being splittable into two antagonistic factions, each containing only friends.},

Unlike for nonnegative graphs, the outcome of a dynamical system evolving on a signed graph is not obvious and it is in general difficult to characterize, even when the dynamics are linear. In this paper we identify a significant class of signed graphs for which the linear dynamics are however predictable and show many analogies with positive dynamical systems. These cases correspond to adjacency matrices that are eventually positive, for which the PerronFrobenius property still holds and implies the existence of an invariant cone contained inside the positive orthant. As examples of applications, we determine cases in which it is possible to anticipate or impose unanimity of opinion in decision/voting processes even in presence of stubborn agents, and show how it is possible to extend the PageRank algorithm to include negative links.},

A multitude of convex sets is considered by each node to model local ambiguities: Any value for the parameter vector in any such set is consistent will local measurements, but not necessarily consistent network-wide. Consensus can be employed to reach an estimate consistent with the measurements of all nodes, assuming that such an estimate exists. Unfortunately, such an approach leads to a non-convex problem. The considered problem is properly decomposed into two sub-problems, where the second is well studied in literature and the first one is modelled as a non-cooperative game, an exact potential function is derived, and an algorithm for its solution is given. Numerical results, consistent with the theoretical findings, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

For any field k we give a presentation of FinVect\_k in terms of the generators used in signal flow diagrams. A broader class of signal-flow diagrams also includes "caps" and "cups" to model feedback. We show these diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the symmetric monoidal category FinRel\_k, where objects are still finite-dimensional vector spaces but the morphisms are linear relations. We also give a presentation for FinRel\_k. The relations say, among other things, that the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative dagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either one and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a bimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum, is familiar from the "ZX-calculus" obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with two mutually unbiased bases.},

Global reliability is typically recovered by collecting all the measurements in a fusion center which takes proper decisions. However, centralized networks are more vulnerable and prone to congestion around the sink nodes. To relax the congestion problem, decrease the network vulnerability and improve the network ef\`Aciency, it is appropriate to bring the decisions at the lowest possible level. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm allowing each node to improve the reliability of its own reading thanks to the interaction with the other nodes, assuming that the \`Aeld monitored by the network is a smooth function. In mathematical terms, this only requires that the useful \`Aeld belongs to a subspace of dimension smaller than the number of nodes. Although fully decentralized, the proposed algorithm is globally optimal, in the sense that it performs the projection of the overall set of observations onto the signal subspace through an iterative decentralized algorithms, that requires minimum convergence time, for any given node coverage.},

In this paper, we expand these tools to the analysis of signals defined on simplicial complexes, whose domain has a structure specified by various multi-way relations. Within this framework, we show how to filter signals and how to reconstruct edge and vertex signals from a subset of observations. Finally, we propose two alternative algorithms to infer the structure of the simplicial complex from the observations.}

This problem, which is naturally posed in terms of a measurement graph, arises in applications such as sensor network localization, time synchronization, and motion consensus. We obtain a characterization on the minimum possible covariance of the estimation error when an arbitrarily large number of measurements are available. This covariance is shown to be equal to a matrix-valued effective resistance in an infinite electrical network. Covariance in large finite graphs converges to this effective resistance as the size of the graphs increases. This convergence result provides the formal justification for regarding large finite graphs as infinite graphs, which can be exploited to determine scaling laws for the estimation error in large finite graphs. Furthermore, these results indicate that in large networks, estimation algorithms that use small subsets of all the available measurements can still obtain accurate estimates. \textcopyright{} 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The canonical problem of solving a system of linear equations arises in numerous contexts in information theory, communication theory, and related fields. In this contribution, we develop a solution based upon Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) that does not involve direct matrix inversion. The iterative nature of our approach allows for a distributed message-passing implementation of the solution algorithm. In the first part of this thesis, we address the properties of the GaBP solver. We characterize the rate of convergence, enhance its message-passing efficiency by introducing a broadcast version, discuss its relation to classical solution methods including numerical examples. We present a new method for forcing the GaBP algorithm to converge to the correct solution for arbitrary column dependent matrices. In the second part we give five applications to illustrate the applicability of the GaBP algorithm to very large computer networks: Peer-to-Peer rating, linear detection, distributed computation of support vector regression, efficient computation of Kalman filter and distributed linear programming. Using extensive simulations on up to 1,024 CPUs in parallel using IBM Bluegene supercomputer we demonstrate the attractiveness and applicability of the GaBP algorithm, using real network topologies with up to millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of communication links. We further relate to several other algorithms and explore their connection to the GaBP algorithm.},

If the subspaces are selected at random, then a measure concentration argument shows that these inner products concentrate near an average value.

Harmonic analysis over this group leads to very simple finite dimensional reductions. We then apply these ideas to the inpainting problem which is reduced to the integration of a completely parallelizable finite set of Mathieu-type diffusions (indexed by the dual of SE(2, N ) in place of the points of the Fourier plane, which is a drastic reduction). The integration of the the Mathieu equations can be performed by standard numerical methods for elliptic diffusions and leads to a very simple and efficient class of inpainting algorithms. We illustrate the performances of the method on a series of deeply corrupted images.},

Graph clustering and community detection have traditionally focused on graphs without attributes, with the notable exception of edge weights. However, these models only provide a partial representation of real social systems, that are thus often described using node attributes, representing features of the actors, and edge attributes, representing different kinds of relationships among them. We refer to these models as attributed graphs. Consequently, existing graph clustering methods have been recently extended to deal with node and edge attributes. This article is a literature survey on this topic, organizing and presenting recent research results in a uniform way, characterizing the main existing clustering methods and highlighting their conceptual differences. We also cover the important topic of clustering evaluation and identify current open problems.},

In this paper, we consider an extension called heterogeneous MRA, where \$K\$ signals must be estimated, and each observation comes from one of those signals, unknown to us. This is a simplified model for the heterogeneity problem notably arising in cryo-electron microscopy. We propose an algorithm which estimates the \$K\$ signals without estimating either the shifts or the classes of the observations. It requires only one pass over the data and is based on low-order moments that are invariant under cyclic shifts. Given sufficiently many measurements, one can estimate these invariant features averaged over the \$K\$ signals. We then design a smooth, non-convex optimization problem to compute a set of signals which are consistent with the estimated averaged features. We find that, in many cases, the proposed approach estimates the set of signals accurately despite non-convexity, and conjecture the number of signals \$K\$ that can be resolved as a function of the signal length \$L\$ is on the order of \$\textbackslash sqrt\{L\}\$.},

We prove that if the position and orientation of the drone on which the microphones are mounted do not lie on a certain set of dimension at most 5 in the six-dimensional space of all drone positions and orientations, then the wall assignment obtained through our echo sorting criterion must be the right one and thus the reconstruction obtained through our algorithm is correct.

Nodes in such networks operate under limited computational, communication and energy resources. These constraints naturally give rise to "gossip" algorithms: schemes which distribute the computational burden and in which a node communicates with a randomly chosen neighbor. We analyze the averaging problem under the gossip constraint for arbitrary network, and find that the averaging time of a gossip algorithm depends on the second largest eigenvalue of a doubly stochastic matrix characterizing the algorithm. Using recent results of Boyd, Diaconis and Xiao (2003), we show that minimizing this quantity to design the fastest averaging algorithm on the network is a semi-definite program (SDP). In general, SDPs cannot be solved distributedly; however, exploiting problem structure, we propose a subgradient method that distributedly solves the optimization problem over the network. The relation of averaging time to the second largest eigenvalue naturally relates it to the mixing time of a random walk with transition probabilities that are derived from the gossip algorithm. We use this connection to study the performance of gossip algorithm on two popular networks: wireless sensor networks, which are modeled as geometric random graphs, and the Internet graph under the so-called preferential connectivity model.},

In particular, we would like to use deep neural networks, which have recently proven to be powerful tools for a broad range of problems from computer vision, natural language processing, and audio analysis. However, these tools have been most successful on data with an underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure, and in cases where the invariances of these structures are built into networks used to model them. Geometric deep learning is an umbrella term for emerging techniques attempting to generalize (structured) deep neural models to non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and manifolds. The purpose of this paper is to overview different examples of geometric deep learning problems and present available solutions, key difficulties, applications, and future research directions in this nascent field.},

In spite of the sophistication of the recently proposed methods, most algorithms have not yet attained a desirable level of applicability. All show an outstanding performance when the image model corresponds to the algorithm assumptions but fail in general and create artifacts or remove image fine structures. The main focus of this paper is, first, to define a general mathematical and experimental methodology to compare and classify classical image denoising algorithms and, second, to propose a nonlocal means (NL-means) algorithm addressing the preservation of structure in a digital image. The mathematical analysis is based on the analysis of the ``method noise,'' defined as the difference between a digital image and its denoised version. The NL-means algorithm is proven to be asymptotically optimal under a generic statistical image model. The denoising performance of all considered methods are compared in four ways; mathematical: asymptotic order of magnitude of the method noise under regularity assumptions; perceptual-mathematical: the algorithms artifacts and their explanation as a violation of the image model; quantitative experimental: by tables of L2 distances of the denoised version to the original image. The most powerful evaluation method seems, however, to be the visualization of the method noise on natural images. The more this method noise looks like a real white noise, the better the method.},

The best explicit examples of diffusers are defined by means of the action of elements of the matrix group \$SL (2,\{\textbackslash bf Z\} )\$ on certain finite mathematical objects. Some corresponding, explicit expanders were introduced by Margulis. However, Gabber and Galil were the first to obtain good estimates for the expanders and produce from them a family of directed acyclic superconcentrators having density 271.8. In this paper we review various techniques for making expanders from diffusers. We also demonstrate asymptotic upper bounds on the strength of algebraically defined classes of degree k diffusers. Each upper bound is given as the norm of a diffusion operator on an infinite discrete group, and bounds for several examples are calculated. Numerical evidence is supplied in support of our conjecture that these bounds can be achieved by certain algebraically defined examples. The conjecture, if true, would lead to superconcentrators of density less than 58.},

Despite its wide use, however, it has long been recognized that the method has a fundamental flaw: It works poorly on networks that contain short loops. Loops introduce correlations that can cause the method to give inaccurate answers or to fail completely in the worst cases. Unfortunately, most real-world networks contain many short loops, which limits the usefulness of the message-passing approach. In this paper we demonstrate how to rectify this shortcoming and create message-passing methods that work on any network. We give 2 example applications, one to the percolation properties of networks and the other to the calculation of the spectra of sparse matrices.},

We study the system under an Eulerian point of view considering (possibly continuous) probability distributions of agents, and we present original convergence results. The limit distribution is always necessarily a convex combination of delta functions at least R far apart from each other: in other terms these models are locally aggregating. The Eulerian perspective provides the natural framework for designing a numerical algorithm, by which we obtain several simulations in 1 and 2 dimensions.},

In the present work, we illustrate new insights into different aspects of this theory. We shed light on the power of detection of the cohomological obstruction by showing that it is not a complete invariant for strong contextuality even under symmetry and connectedness restrictions on the measurement cover, disproving a previous conjecture. We generalise obstructions to higher cohomology groups and show that they give rise to a refinement of the notion of cohomological contextuality: different "levels" of contextuality are organised in a hierarchy of logical implications. Finally, we present an alternative description of the first cohomology group in terms of torsors, resulting in a new interpretation of the cohomological obstructions.},

That is, we precisely determine the conditions under which there exists a set of equal-rank orthogonal projection matrices whose sum is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. The characterizing set of requirements is very mild, and as such, these frames often exist. Our methods are completely constructive, relying on a new, flexible and elementary method for constructing unit norm tight frames.},

  abstract = {Our goal in this paper is to show that many of the tools of signal processing, adapted Fourier and wavelet analysis can be naturally lifted to the setting of digital data clouds, graphs, and manifolds. We use diffusion as a smoothing and scaling tool to enable coarse graining and multiscale analysis. Given a diffusion operator T on a manifold or a graph, with large powers of low rank, we present a general multiresolution construction for efficiently computing, representing and compressing Tt. This allows a direct multiscale computation, to high precision, of functions of the operator, notably the associated Green's function, in compressed form, and their fast application. Classes of operators for which these computations are fast include certain diffusion-like operators, in any dimension, on manifolds, graphs, and in non-homogeneous media. We use ideas related to the Fast Multipole Methods and to the wavelet analysis of Calder\'on\textendash Zygmund and pseudo-differential operators, to numerically enforce the emergence of a natural hierarchical coarse graining of a manifold, graph or data set. For example for a body of text documents the construction leads to a directory structure at different levels of generalization. The dyadic powers of an operator can be used to induce a multiresolution analysis, as in classical Littlewood\textendash Paley and wavelet theory: we construct, with efficient and stable algorithms, bases of orthonormal scaling functions and wavelets associated to this multiresolution analysis, together with the corresponding downsampling operators, and use them to compress the corresponding powers of the operator.

A number of recent developments building upon classical work has led to a rich understanding of ``symmetric hyperdeterminants'' of hypermatrices, a.k.a. multidimensional arrays. Symmetric hyperdeterminants share many properties with determinants, but the context of multilinear algebra is substantially more complicated than the linear algebra required to address Spectral Graph Theory (i.e., ordinary matrices). Nonetheless, it is possible to define eigenvalues of a hypermatrix via its characteristic polynomial as well as variationally. We apply this notion to the ``adjacency hypermatrix'' of a uniform hypergraph, and prove a number of natural analogs of basic results in Spectral Graph Theory. Open problems abound, and we present a number of directions for further study.},

Personality and psychopathology networks are typically based on correlation matrices and therefore include both positive and negative edge signs. However, some applications of network analysis disregard negative edges, such as computing clustering coefficients. In this contribution, we illustrate the importance of the distinction between positive and negative edges in networks based on correlation matrices. The clustering coefficient is generalized to signed correlation networks: three new indices are introduced that take edge signs into account, each derived from an existing and widely used formula. The performances of the new indices are illustrated and compared with the performances of the unsigned indices, both on a signed simulated network and on a signed network based on actual personality psychology data. The results show that the new indices are more resistant to sample variations in correlation networks and therefore have higher convergence compared with the unsigned indices both in simulated networks and with real data.},

  abstract = {When simulating multiscale stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in high-dimensions, separation of timescales, stochastic noise and high-dimensionality can make simulations prohibitively expensive. The computational cost is dictated by microscale properties and interactions of many variables, while the behavior of interest often occurs at the macroscale level and at large time scales, often characterized by few important, but unknown, degrees of freedom. For many problems bridging the gap between the microscale and macroscale by direct simulation is computationally infeasible. In this work we propose a novel approach to automatically learn a reduced model with an associated fast macroscale simulator. Our unsupervised learning algorithm uses short parallelizable microscale simulations to learn provably accurate macroscale SDE models, which are continuous in space and time. The learning algorithm takes as input: the microscale simulator, a local distance function, and a homogenization spatial or temporal scale, which is the smallest time scale of interest in the reduced system. The learned macroscale model can then be used for fast computation and storage of long simulations. We prove guarantees that related the number of short paths requested from the microscale simulator to the accuracy of the learned macroscale simulator. We discuss various examples, both low- and high-dimensional, as well as results about the accuracy of the fast simulators we construct, and its dependency on the number of short paths requested from the microscale simulator.},

  abstract = {The classical max-flow min-cut theorem describes transport through certain idealized classical networks. We consider the quantum analog for tensor networks. By associating an integral capacity to each edge and a tensor to each vertex in a flow network, we can also interpret it as a tensor network, and more specifically, as a linear map from the input space to the output space. The quantum max flow is defined to be the maximal rank of this linear map over all choices of tensors. The quantum min cut is defined to be the minimum product of the capacities of edges over all cuts of the tensor network. We show that unlike the classical case, the quantum max-flow=min-cut conjecture is not true in general. Under certain conditions, e.g., when the capacity on each edge is some power of a fixed integer, the quantum max-flow is proved to equal the quantum min-cut. However, concrete examples are also provided where the equality does not hold. We also found connections of quantum max-flow/min-cut with entropy of entanglement and the quantum satisfiability problem. We speculate that the phenomena revealed may be of interest both in spin systems in condensed matter and in quantum gravity.},

  abstract = {Constructible and perverse sheaves are the algebraic counterpart of the decomposition of a singular space into smooth manifolds, a great geometrical idea due to R. Thom and H. Whitney. These sheaves, generalizing the local systems that are so ubiquitous in mathematics, have powerful applications to the topology of such singular spaces (mainly algebraic and analytic complex varieties). This introduction to the subject can be regarded as a textbook on "Modern Algebraic Topology'', which treats the cohomology of spaces with sheaf coefficients (as opposed to the classical constant coefficient cohomology). The first five chapters introduce derived categories, direct and inverse images of sheaf complexes, Verdier duality, constructible and perverse sheaves, vanishing and characteristic cycles. They also discuss relations to D-modules and intersection cohomology. The final chapters apply this powerful tool to the study of the topology of singularities, of polynomial functions and of hyperplane arrangements. Some fundamental results, for which excellent sources exist, are not proved but just stated and illustrated by examples and corollaries. In this way, the reader is guided rather quickly from the A-B-C of the theory to current research questions, supported in this by a wealth of examples and exercises.},

Specifically, graph learning problems are posed as estimation of graph Laplacian matrices from some observed data under given structural constraints (e.g., graph connectivity and sparsity level). From a probabilistic perspective, the problems of interest correspond to maximum a posteriori (MAP) parameter estimation of Gaussian-Markov random field (GMRF) models, whose precision (inverse covariance) is a graph Laplacian matrix. For the proposed graph learning problems, specialized algorithms are developed by incorporating the graph Laplacian and structural constraints. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Graphs are fundamental mathematical structures used in various fields to represent data, signals, and processes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for learning/estimating graphs from data. The proposed framework includes (i) formulation of various graph learning problems, (ii) their probabilistic interpretations, and (iii) associated algorithms. Specifically, graph learning problems are posed as the estimation of graph Laplacian matrices from some observed data under given structural constraints (e.g., graph connectivity and sparsity level). From a probabilistic perspective, the problems of interest correspond to maximum a posteriori parameter estimation of Gaussian-Markov random field models, whose precision (inverse covariance) is a graph Laplacian matrix. For the proposed graph learning problems, specialized algorithms are developed by incorporating the graph Laplacian and structural constraints. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Control theory uses `signal-flow diagrams' to describe processes where real-valued functions of time are added, multiplied by scalars, differentiated and integrated, duplicated and deleted. These diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the PROP FinRel\_k, the strict version of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field of rational functions k = R(s) and linear relations, where the variable s acts as differentiation and the monoidal structure is direct sum rather than the usual tensor product of vector spaces. Control processes are also described by controllability and observability---whether the input can drive the process to any state, and whether any state can be determined from later outputs. For any field k we give a presentation of FinRel\_k in terms of generators of the free PROP of signal-flow diagrams together with the equations that give FinRel\_k its structure. The `cap' and `cup' generators, missing when the morphisms are linear maps, make it possible to model feedback. The relations say, among other things, that the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative dagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either one and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a bimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum, is familiar from the `ZX-calculus' obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with two mutually unbiased bases. In order to address controllability and observability, we construct the PROP Stateful\_k and relate it back to the PROP of signal-flow diagrams. This provides a way to graphically express controllability and observability for linear time-invariant processes.},

  abstract = {An equiangular tight frame (ETF) is a sequence of unit-norm vectors in a Euclidean space whose coherence achieves equality in the Welch bound, and thus yields an optimal packing in a projective space. A regular simplex is a simple type of ETF in which the number of vectors is one more than the dimension of the underlying space. More sophisticated examples include harmonic ETFs which equate to difference sets in finite abelian groups. Recently, it was shown that some harmonic ETFs are comprised of regular simplices. In this paper, we continue the investigation into these special harmonic ETFs. We begin by characterizing when the subspaces that are spanned by the ETF's regular simplices form an equi-isoclinic tight fusion frame (EITFF), which is a type of optimal packing in a Grassmannian space. We shall see that every difference set that produces an EITFF in this way also yields a complex circulant conference matrix. Next, we consider a subclass of these difference sets that can be factored in terms of a smaller difference set and a relative difference set. It turns out that these relative difference sets lend themselves to a second, related and yet distinct, construction of complex circulant conference matrices. Finally, we provide explicit infinite families of ETFs to which this theory applies.},

The behavioural approach places open systems at its centre, modelling by tearing, zooming, and linking. We show that these ideas are naturally expressed in the language of symmetric monoidal categories.Our main result gives an intuitive sound and fully complete string diagram algebra for reasoning about LTI systems. These string diagrams are closely related to the classical notion of signal flow graphs, endowed with semantics as multi-input multi-output transducers that process discrete streams with an infinite past as well as an infinite future. At the categorical level, the algebraic characterisation is that of the prop of corelations.Using this framework, we derive a novel structural characterisation of controllability, and consequently provide a methodology for analysing controllability of networked and interconnected systems. We argue that this has the potential of providing elegant, simple, and efficient solutions to problems arising in the analysis of systems over networks, a vibrant research area at the crossing of control theory and computer science.},

The discipline was established in Europe in the aftermath of the American and French Revolutions. With the dismantling of the hierarchical controls of European aristocratic systems, the examination of alternative mechanisms of coordination and control became a preoccupation. The Industrial Revolution (c. 1760-1840), which was occurring at the same time, reinforced this preoccupation by decoupling the power of purse and the power of positions of authority. While the hierarchies of church and state retained coercive power, the exercise of such power was increasingly contested. The moral compass of society, its general welfare, and its capacity to adapt to changing circumstances appeared to be aggregated properties of the unconstrained opinions and behaviors of a large collectivity of individuals. The definition of the problem of coordination and control, which emerged in Europe in the new discipline of sociology, still resonates and guides current sociological work. The problem definition [1], broadly stated, is this: if value is placed on nonhierarchical mechanisms of social control, then what mechanisms and structures (consistent with this value) allow a coordination and control of social systems?},

We start with the selection graph neural network (GNN), which replaces linear time invariant filters with linear shift invariant graph filters to generate convolutional features and reinterprets pooling as a possibly nonlinear subsampling stage where nearby nodes pool their information in a set of preselected sample nodes. A key component of the architecture is to remember the position of sampled nodes to permit computation of convolutional features at deeper layers. The second architecture, dubbed aggregation GNN, diffuses the signal through the graph and stores the sequence of diffused components observed by a designated node. This procedure effectively aggregates all components into a stream of information having temporal structure to which the convolution and pooling stages of regular CNNs can be applied. A multinode version of aggregation GNNs is further introduced for operation in large scale graphs. An important property of selection and aggregation GNNs is that they reduce to conventional CNNs when particularized to time signals reinterpreted as graph signals in a circulant graph. Comparative numerical analyses are performed in a source localization application over synthetic and real-world networks. Performance is also evaluated for an authorship attribution problem and text category classification. Multinode aggregation GNNs are consistently the best performing GNN architecture.},

We demonstrate the advantage of incorporating such additional information and study the asymptotic behavior of HDM on general fibre bundles. In a broader context, HDM reveals the sub-Riemannian structure of high-dimensional data sets, and provides a nonparametric learning framework for data sets with structural correspondences.},

We present the main results available in the literature about the analysis and design of linear consensus algorithms,for both synchronous and asynchronous implementations. We then show that many control, optimization and estimation problems such as least squares, sensor calibration, vehicle coordination and Kalman filtering can be cast as the computation of some sort of averages, therefore being suitable for consensus algorithms. We finally conclude by presenting very recent studies about the performance of many of these control and estimation problems, which give rise to novel metrics for the consensus algorithms. These indexes of performance are rather different from more traditional metrics like the rate of convergence and have fundamental consequences on the design of consensus algorithms.},

  abstract = {The scale and complexity of modern data sets and the limitations associated with testing large numbers of hypotheses underline the need for feature selection methods. Spectral techniques rank features according to their degree of consistency with an underlying metric structure, but their current graph-based formulation restricts their applicability to point features. We extend spectral methods for feature selection to abstract simplicial complexes and present a general framework which can be applied to 2-point and higher-order features. Combinatorial Laplacian scores take into account the topology spanned by the data and reduce to the ordinary Laplacian score in the case of point features. We demonstrate the utility of spectral simplicial methods for feature selection with several examples of application to the analysis of gene expression and multi-modal genomic data. Our results provide a unifying perspective on topological data analysis and manifold learning approaches.},

Our approach is based on defining scaling using the the graph analogue of the Fourier domain, namely the spectral decomposition of the discrete graph Laplacian \$\textbackslash L\$. Given a wavelet generating kernel \$g\$ and a scale parameter \$t\$, we define the scaled wavelet operator \$T\_g\^t = g(t\textbackslash L)\$. The spectral graph wavelets are then formed by localizing this operator by applying it to an indicator function. Subject to an admissibility condition on \$g\$, this procedure defines an invertible transform. We explore the localization properties of the wavelets in the limit of fine scales. Additionally, we present a fast Chebyshev polynomial approximation algorithm for computing the transform that avoids the need for diagonalizing \$\textbackslash L\$. We highlight potential applications of the transform through examples of wavelets on graphs corresponding to a variety of different problem domains.},

Classically, principal components of a dataset are interpreted as the directions that preserve most of its "energy", an interpretation that is theoretically underpinned by the celebrated Eckart-Young-Mirsky Theorem. There are yet other ways of interpreting PCA that are rarely exploited in practice, largely because it is not known how to reliably solve the corresponding non-convex optimisation programs. In this paper, we consider one such interpretation of principal components as the directions that preserve most of the "volume" of the dataset. Our main contribution is a theorem that shows that the corresponding non-convex program has no spurious local optima. We apply a number of solvers for empirical confirmation.},

The resulting object is highly natural, with basic connections to a variety of fields in pure mathematics, engineering, and the sciences. For the purpose of exposition we focus the discussion of applications on homological algebra and computation, with additional remarks in lattice theory, linear algebra, and abelian categories. For motivation, we recall that the methods of algebraic topology have driven remarkable progress in the qualitative study of large, noisy bodies of data over the past 15 years. A primary tool in Topological Data Analysis [TDA] is the homological persistence module, which leverages categorical structure to compare algebraic shape descriptors across multiple scales of measurement. Our principle application to computation is a novel algorithm to calculate persistent homology which, in certain cases, improves the state of the art by several orders of magnitude. Included are novel results in discrete, spectral, and algebraic Morse theory, and on the strong maps of matroid theory. The defining theme throughout is interplay between the combinatorial theory matroids and the algebraic theory of categories. The nature of these interactions is remarkably simple, but their consequences in homological algebra, quiver theory, and combinatorial optimization represent new and widely open fields for interaction between the disciplines.},

Although aspects of weighted network analysis relate to standard data mining methods, the intuitive network language and analysis framework transcend any particular analysis method. Weighted networks give rise to data reduction methods, clustering procedures, visualization methods, data exploratory methods, and intuitive approaches for integrating disparate data sets. Weighted networks have been used to analyze a variety of high dimensional genomic data sets including gene expression-, epigenetic-, methylation-, proteomics-, and fMRI- data. Chapters explore the fascinating topological structure of weighted networks and provide geometric interpretations of network methods. Powerful systems-level analysis methods result from combining network- with data mining methods. The book not only describes the WGCNA R package but also other software packages. Weighted gene co-expression network applications, real data sets, and exercises guide the reader on how to use these methods in practice, e.g. in systems-biologic or systems-genetic applications. The material is self-contained and only requires a minimum knowledge of statistics. The book is intended for students, faculty, and data analysts in many fields including bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics, computer science, biology, genetics, applied mathematics, physics, and social science.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel mathematical framework to address the problem of automatically solving large jigsaw puzzles. This problem assumes a large image, which is cut into equal square pieces that are arbitrarily rotated and shuffled, and asks to recover the original image given the transformed pieces. The main contribution of this work is a method for recovering the rotations of the pieces when both shuffles and rotations are unknown. A major challenge of this procedure is estimating the graph connection Laplacian without the knowledge of shuffles. We guarantee some robustness of the latter estimate to measurement errors. A careful combination of our proposed method for estimating rotations with any existing method for estimating shuffles results in a practical solution for the jigsaw puzzle problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of this solution.},

Each agent's heading is updated using a local rule based on the average of its own heading plus the headings of its ``neighbors.'' In their paper, Vicsek et al. provide simulation results which demonstrate that the nearest neighbor rule they are studying can cause all agents to eventually move in the same direction despite the absence of centralized coordination and despite the fact that each agent's set of nearest neighbors change with time as the system evolves. This paper provides a theoretical explanation for this observed behavior. In addition, convergence results are derived for several other similarly inspired models. The Vicsek model proves to be a graphic example of a switched linear system which is stable, but for which there does not exist a common quadratic Lyapunov function.},

  abstract = {[The special class of linear programs described as network flow problems includes many of the special structure optimization problems in such areas as assignment, transportation, catering, warehousing, production scheduling, etc. Besides the physical motivation of the flow description, this class of problems possesses conceptually simple, and computationally elegant, solution techniques originated by Dantzig, Ford, Fulkerson, et al. This paper describes a generalization of this class of problems to 'process-flow networks,' or 'flow with gains,' in which flow in any branches of the network may be multiplied by an arbitrary constant, called the branch gain, before leaving the branch and flowing into the remainder of the network. This generalization permits the description of networks in which different kinds of flow may be converted one to another, without 'constant returns to scale.' Among other interesting problems, this model includes the metal-processing problem, the machine-loading problem, financial budgeting, air-craft routing, warehousing with 'breeding' or 'evaporation,' the two-equation capacitated linear program, etc. The solution method here described and proved is a natural extension of Ford and Fulkerson's technique (or specialization of the primal-dual method) and retains much of the physical motivation and easy computational aspect of their technique; a direct starting solution is usually available, and optimization of the imbedded linear program (the restricted primal problem) can be accomplished without the use of the simplex technique. Conceptually, the solution procedure consists of the following steps: (1) Find the incrementally cheapest loop in the network that will absorb flow. (2) Establish as much additional flow into the network along this route as possible. (3) Repeat Steps (1) and (2) until the desired flow is established, or until infeasibility is discovered. The solution technique includes a maximal-flow procedure and produces a 'min-cut equals max-flow' theorem for networks with gains. Additional features, such as piece-wise linear convex costs, parametric studies, network 'tearing,' mixed boundary conditions, etc., may be easily incorporated in the algorithm.]},

  abstract = {We propose a technique that we call HodgeRank for ranking data that may be incomplete and imbalanced, characteristics common in modern datasets coming from e-commerce and internet applications. We are primarily interested in cardinal data based on scores or ratings though our methods also give specific insights on ordinal data. From raw ranking data, we construct pairwise rankings, represented as edge flows on an appropriate graph. Our statistical ranking method exploits the graph Helmholtzian, which is the graph theoretic analogue of the Helmholtz operator or vector Laplacian, in much the same way the graph Laplacian is an analogue of the Laplace operator or scalar Laplacian. We shall study the graph Helmholtzian using combinatorial Hodge theory, which provides a way to unravel ranking information from edge flows. In particular, we show that every edge flow representing pairwise ranking can be resolved into two orthogonal components, a gradient flow that represents the l2-optimal global ranking and a divergence-free flow (cyclic) that measures the validity of the global ranking obtained\textemdash if this is large, then it indicates that the data does not have a good global ranking. This divergence-free flow can be further decomposed orthogonally into a curl flow (locally cyclic) and a harmonic flow (locally acyclic but globally cyclic); these provides information on whether inconsistency in the ranking data arises locally or globally. When applied to statistical ranking problems, Hodge decomposition sheds light on whether a given dataset may be globally ranked in a meaningful way or if the data is inherently inconsistent and thus could not have any reasonable global ranking; in the latter case it provides information on the nature of the inconsistencies. An obvious advantage over the NP-hardness of Kemeny optimization is that HodgeRank may be easily computed via a linear least squares regression. We also discuss connections with well-known ordinal ranking techniques such as Kemeny optimization and Borda count from social choice theory.},

It introduces separably estimable observation models that generalize the observability condition in linear centralized estimation to nonlinear distributed estimation. It studies two distributed estimation algorithms in separably estimable models, theNU(with its linear counterpartLU) and theNLU. Their update rule combines a consensus step (where each sensor updates the state by weight averaging it with its neighbors' states) and an innovation step (where each sensor processes its local current observation). This makes the three algorithms of the consensus + innovations type, very different from traditional consensus. This paper proves consistency (all sensors reach consensus almost surely and converge to the true parameter value), efficiency, and asymptotic unbiasedness. ForLUandNU, it proves asymptotic normality and provides convergence rate guarantees. The three algorithms are characterized by appropriately chosen decaying weight sequences.

In this paper, we focus on a particular problem setting consisting of a physical phenomenon or a system of interest observed by multiple sensors. We assume that all sensors measure some aspects of the system of interest with additional sensor-specific and irrelevant components. Our goal is to recover the variables relevant to the observed system and to filter out the nuisance effects of the sensor-specific variables. We propose an approach based on manifold learning, which is particularly suitable for problems with multiple modalities, since it aims to capture the intrinsic structure of the data and relies on minimal prior model knowledge. Specifically, we propose a nonlinear filtering scheme, which extracts the hidden sources of variability captured by two or more sensors, that are independent of the sensor-specific components. In addition to presenting a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate our technique on real measured data for the purpose of sleep stage assessment based on multiple, multimodal sensor measurements. We show that without prior knowledge on the different modalities and on the measured system, our method gives rise to a data-driven representation that is well correlated with the underlying sleep process and is robust to noise and sensor-specific effects.},

First we study connection graphs, which are weighted graphs in which each edge is associated with a d-dimensional rotation matrix for some fixed dimension d, in addition to a scalar weight. Second, we study non-backtracking random walks on graphs, which are random walks with the additional constraint that they cannot return to the immediately previous state at any given step. Our work in connection graphs is centered on the notion of consistency, that is, the product of rotations moving from one vertex to another is independent of the path taken, and a generalization called epsilon-consistency. We present higher dimensional versions of the combinatorial Laplacian matrix and normalized Laplacian matrix from spectral graph theory, and give results characterizing the consistency of a connection graph in terms of the spectra of these matrices. We generalize several tools from classical spectral graph theory, such as PageRank and effective resistance, to apply to connection graphs. We use these tools to give algorithms for sparsification, clustering, and noise reduction on connection graphs. non-backtracking random walks, we address the question raised by Alon et. al. concerning how the mixing rate of a non-backtracking random walk to its stationary distribution compares to the mixing rate for an ordinary random walk. Alon et. al. address this question for regular graphs. We take a different approach, and use a generalization of Ihara's Theorem to give a new proof of Alon's result for regular graphs, and to extend the result to biregular graphs. Finally, we give a non-backtracking version of Polya's Random Walk Theorem for 2-dimensional grids},

  abstract = {In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time, and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such "multilayer" features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize "traditional" network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other, and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts, and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks, and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions, and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a unified and entirely geometrical methodology for generating 2D and 3D force diagrams for given planar and spatial trusses in static equilibrium within the context of graphic statics. The trusses, regarded as form diagrams, are projections of higher dimensional simply-connected stress functions, can be either self\textemdash stressed or loaded with external forces, and need not be tension-only/ compression-only. First, we provide an in-depth overview of fundamental notions of graphic statics and projective geometry related to the construction of reciprocal form and force diagrams. Specifically, we describe a series of polar transformations and discuss them from a geometric and an algebraic standpoint. Moreover, we provide an exegesis and visualization of Maxwell's reciprocal methods while discussing them within the scientific framework of his time. We then develop a contemporary graphic statics framework grounded on projective geometry and higher-dimensional reciprocal stress functions. Within this framework, we provide a general methodology for deriving any type of reciprocal diagrams for the planar and the spatial case. Advantages of this method include: direct control on any of the four reciprocal objects (form diagram, force diagram, corresponding stress functions) and no need for iterative/ procedural reconstruction of any of the diagrams since it is based on direct geometrical transformations. Finally, we highlight how duality, and in particular polarity, can be used for a wide range of applications in structural analysis and design.},

  abstract = {One of the difficulties in 3D reconstruction of molecules from images in single particle Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM), in addition to high levels of noise and unknown image orientations, is heterogeneity in samples: in many cases, the samples contain a mixture of molecules, or multiple conformations of one molecule. Many algorithms for the reconstruction of molecules from images in heterogeneous Cryo-EM experiments are based on iterative approximations of the molecules in a non-convex optimization that is prone to reaching suboptimal local minima. Other algorithms require an alignment in order to perform classification, or vice versa. The recently introduced Non-Unique Games framework provides a representation theoretic approach to studying problems of alignment over compact groups, and offers convex relaxations for alignment problems which are formulated as semidefinite programs (SDPs) with certificates of global optimality under certain circumstances. In this manuscript, we propose to extend Non-Unique Games to the problem of simultaneous alignment and classification with the goal of simultaneously classifying Cryo-EM images and aligning them within their respective classes. Our proposed approach can also be extended to the case of continuous heterogeneity.},

Noticing that \$\textbackslash Omega(m)\$ time is needed for any algorithm to construct a spectral sparsifier and a spectral sparsifier of \$G\$ requires \$\textbackslash Omega(n)\$ edges, a natural question is to investigate, for any constant \$\textbackslash varepsilon\$, if a \$(1+\textbackslash varepsilon)\$-spectral sparsifier of \$G\$ with \$O(n)\$ edges can be constructed in \$\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(m)\$ time, where the \$\textbackslash tilde\{O\}\$ notation suppresses polylogarithmic factors. All previous constructions on spectral sparsification require either super-linear number of edges or \$m\^\{1+\textbackslash Omega(1)\}\$ time. In this work we answer this question affirmatively by presenting an algorithm that, for any undirected graph \$G\$ and \$\textbackslash varepsilon{$>$}0\$, outputs a \$(1+\textbackslash varepsilon)\$-spectral sparsifier of \$G\$ with \$O(n/\textbackslash varepsilon\^2)\$ edges in \$\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(m/\textbackslash varepsilon\^\{O(1)\})\$ time. Our algorithm is based on three novel techniques: (1) a new potential function which is much easier to compute yet has similar guarantees as the potential functions used in previous references; (2) an efficient reduction from a two-sided spectral sparsifier to a one-sided spectral sparsifier; (3) constructing a one-sided spectral sparsifier by a semi-definite program.},

In contrast to the bulk of research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive interpretations of links between people, we study how the interplay between positive and negative relationships affects the structure of on-line social networks. We connect our analyses to theories of signed networks from social psychology. We find that the classical theory of structural balance tends to capture certain common patterns of interaction, but that it is also at odds with some of the fundamental phenomena we observe \textemdash{} particularly related to the evolving, directed nature of these on-line networks. We then develop an alternate theory of status that better explains the observed edge signs and provides insights into the underlying social mechanisms. Our work provides one of the first large-scale evaluations of theories of signed networks using on-line datasets, as well as providing a perspective for reasoning about social media sites.},

Geometric Multi-Resolution Analysis (GMRA) provides a robust and computationally efficient procedure to construct low-dimensional geometric approximations of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\$ at varying resolutions. We introduce a thresholding algorithm on the geometric wavelet coefficients, leading to what we call adaptive GMRA approximations. We show that these data-driven, empirical approximations perform well, when the threshold is chosen as a suitable universal function of the number of samples \$n\$, on a wide variety of measures \$\textbackslash rho\$, that are allowed to exhibit different regularity at different scales and locations, thereby efficiently encoding data from more complex measures than those supported on manifolds. These approximations yield a data-driven dictionary, together with a fast transform mapping data to coefficients, and an inverse of such a map. The algorithms for both the dictionary construction and the transforms have complexity \$C n \textbackslash log n\$ with the constant linear in \$D\$ and exponential in \$d\$. Our work therefore establishes adaptive GMRA as a fast dictionary learning algorithm with approximation guarantees. We include several numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data, confirming our theoretical results and demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive GMRA.},

  abstract = {The celebrated Cheeger's Inequality [AM85,a86] establishes a bound on the expansion of a graph via its spectrum. This inequality is central to a rich spectral theory of graphs, based on studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs. It has remained open to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be used to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph. In this paper we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator generalizing the Laplacian matrix of graphs. Our operator can be viewed as the gradient operator applied to a certain natural quadratic form for hypergraphs. We show that various hypergraph parameters (for e.g. expansion, diameter, etc) can be bounded using this operator's eigenvalues. We study the heat diffusion process associated with this Laplacian operator, and bound its parameters in terms of its spectra. All our results are generalizations of the corresponding results for graphs. We show that there can be no linear operator for hypergraphs whose spectra captures hypergraph expansion in a Cheeger-like manner. Our Laplacian operator is non-linear, and thus computing its eigenvalues exactly is intractable. For any k, we give a polynomial time algorithm to compute an approximation to the kth smallest eigenvalue of the operator. We show that this approximation factor is optimal under the SSE hypothesis (introduced by [RS10]) for constant values of k. Finally, using the factor preserving reduction from vertex expansion in graphs to hypergraph expansion, we show that all our results for hypergraphs extend to vertex expansion in graphs.},

We give a precise characterization of this class of models, and relate it to other classes including diagonally dominant, attractive, nonfrustrated, and pairwise-normalizable. We provide a walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian belief propagation in trees and of the approximate method of loopy belief propagation in graphs with cycles.

The vertices and edges of dual abstract 4-polytopes are embedded within dual four-dimensional vector spaces, wherein the oriented area of generalized polygons give all six components (axial and shear forces with torsion and bending moments) of the stress resultants. The relevant quantities may be readily calculated using four-dimensional Clifford algebra. As well as giving access to frame analysis and design, the description resolves a number of long-standing problems with the incompleteness of Rankine's description of three-dimensional trusses. Examples are given of how the procedure may be applied to structures of engineering interest, including an outline of a two-stage procedure for addressing the equilibrium of loaded gridshell rooves.},

These data are often referred to as unstructured. A first task in its analytics is to derive a low dimensional representation, a graph or discrete manifold, that describes well the interrelations among the time series and their intrarelations across time. This paper presents a computationally tractable algorithm for estimating this graph that structures the data. The resulting graph is directed and weighted, possibly capturing causal relations, not just reciprocal correlations as in many existing approaches in the literature. A convergence analysis is carried out. The algorithm is demonstrated on random graph datasets and real network time series datasets, and its performance is compared to that of related methods. The adjacency matrices estimated with the new method are close to the true graph in the simulated data and consistent with prior physical knowledge in the real dataset tested.},

Eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian have been used extensively for nonlinear dimensionality reduction via spectral embeddings, performing diffusion in irregular spaces, identifying geometrically conspicuous regions in high-dimensional data, training in semi-supervised learning, and more. Leveraging ideas from computational topology, we build from a data set a sequence of graphs with varying coarseness levels, and relate them via simplicial maps. We cascade eigenvectors along these graph relations, not only to accelerate eigenvector computations, but also to yield consistent representations of the associated eigenspaces across scales. Theory is presented for eigenvector cascanding along with general stability results and their application to our framework. For applications relying on several Laplacian eigenvectors, the LOBPCG (locally optimally block preconditioned conjugate gradient) method is employed for iterative eigenvector estimation. We present an application to multiscale TDA (topological data analysis) mapper, illustrating how our methodology identifies consistent features of mapper graphs at different resolutions.},

We show that the associated saddle-point dynamics are asymptotically correct but, in general, not distributed because of the presence of a global penalty parameter. This motivates the design of a discontinuous saddle-point-like algorithm that enjoys the same convergence properties and is fully amenable to distributed implementation. Our convergence proofs rely on the identification of a novel global Lyapunov function for saddle-point dynamics. This novelty also allows us to identify mild convexity and regularity conditions on the objective function that guarantee the exponential convergence rate of the proposed algorithms for convex optimization problems subject to equality constraints.

The goal is to gain insights into collective dominant social beliefs and into the impact of different components of the system, such as users' interactions, while being able to predict users' opinions. Following this thread, in this paper we consider a fairly general dynamical model of social interactions, which captures all the main features exhibited by a social system. For such model, by embracing a mean-field approach, we derive a diffusion differential equation that represents asymptotic belief dynamics, as the number of users grows large. We then analyze the steady-state behavior as well as the time dependent (transient) behavior of the system. In particular, for the steady-state distribution, we obtain simple closed-form expressions for a relevant class of systems, while we propose efficient semi-analytical techniques in the most general cases. At last, we develop an efficient semi-analytical method to analyze the dynamics of the users' belief over time, which can be applied to a remarkably large class of systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss consensus problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

It is robust to perturbations of input data, independent of dimensions and coordinates, and provides a compact representation of the qualitative features of the input. The computation of PH is an open area with numerous important and fascinating challenges. The field of PH computation is evolving rapidly, and new algorithms and software implementations are being updated and released at a rapid pace. The purposes of our article are to (1) introduce theory and computational methods for PH to a broad range of computational scientists and (2) provide benchmarks of state-of-the-art implementations for the computation of PH. We give a friendly introduction to PH, navigate the pipeline for the computation of PH with an eye towards applications, and use a range of synthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate currently available open-source implementations for the computation of PH. Based on our benchmarking, we indicate which algorithms and implementations are best suited to different types of data sets. In an accompanying tutorial, we provide guidelines for the computation of PH. We make publicly available all scripts that we wrote for the tutorial, and we make available the processed version of the data sets used in the benchmarking.},

  abstract = {Image denoising is an under-determined problem, and hence it is important to define appropriate image priors for regularization. One recent popular prior is the graph Laplacian regularizer, where a given pixel patch is assumed to be smooth in the graph-signal domain. The strength and direction of the resulting graph-based filter are computed from the graph's edge weights. In this paper, we derive the optimal edge weights for local graph-based filtering using gradient estimates from non-local pixel patches that are self-similar. To analyze the effects of the gradient estimates on the graph Laplacian regularizer, we first show theoretically that, given graph-signal hDis a set of discrete samples on continuous function h(x; y) in a closed region {$\Omega$}, graph Laplacian regularizer (hD)TLhDconverges to a continuous functional S{$\Omega$}integrating gradient norm of h in metric space G-i.e., ({$\nabla$}h)TG-1({$\nabla$}h)-over {$\Omega$}. We then derive the optimal metric space G*: one that leads to a graph Laplacian regularizer that is discriminant when the gradient estimates are accurate, and robust when the gradient estimates are noisy. Finally, having derived G* we compute the corresponding edge weights to define the Laplacian L used for filtering. Experimental results show that our image denoising algorithm using the per-patch optimal metric space G* outperforms non-local means (NLM) by up to 1.5 dB in PSNR.},

  abstract = {Let X be a closed C\textdegree\textdegree -rrianifold of dimension N. Then two additional structures on X have been quite extensively studied. One is the Riemannian structure giving rise to Riemannian geometry and the other one is the triangulation of X giving rise to polyhedral or combinatorial topology. Sometimes we come across a problem in which we have an invariant for the manifold which has a nice expression in terms of one of these structures and we want to express this invariant in terms of the other structure. Let us consider two examples. Our first example is related to Pontrjagin classes pi9 1 g i g N/4, of the manifold X. If we choose a Riemannian structure on X, then by the well-known Chern-Weil theory (see [2]) we can explicitly write down a closed 4/-form representing the ith Pontrjagin class regarded as an element of H(Z, R). It is an open problem to obtain a combinatorial formula for Pontrjagin classes. We now come to our second example. Our second example refers to Reidemeister-Franz torsion. Let \% be a representation of \%\textbackslash\{X) by orthogonal n x n matrices, n a fixed positive integer. Let \textsterling x be the flat vector bundle on X defined by this representation. Suppose that all the cohomology groups of X with coefficients in the vector bundle \textsterling z are zero. Then one can define an invariant known as Reidemeister-Franz torsion (see [3] and [4]) depending on X and \%. To define this torsion one first chooses a smooth triangulation of X and in terms of this triangulation one defines an invariant which one proves is not changed if we consider subdivisions of the triangulation. We do not have so far a definition for this torsion which does not make use of the choice of a triangulation. It is an interesting open problem to define this invariant in terms of a Riemannian structure. There is a conjecture of Ray and Singer (see [4]) in this direction. They define an invariant which they call analytic torsion. The Ray-Singer analytic torsion is\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {The legacy of Joseph Fourier in science is vast, especially thanks to the essential tool that the Fourier transform is. The flexibility of this analysis, its computational efficiency and the physical interpretation it offers makes it a cornerstone in many scientific domains. With the explosion of digital data, both in quantity and diversity, the generalization of the tools based on Fourier transform is mandatory. In data science, new problems arose for the processing of irregular data such as social networks, biological networks or other data on networks. Graph signal processing is a promising approach to deal with those. The present text is an overview of the state of the art in graph signal processing, focusing on how to define a Fourier transform for data on graphs, how to interpret it and how to use it to process such data. It closes showing some examples of use. Along the way, the review reveals how Fourier's work remains modern and universal, and how his concepts, coming from physics and blended with mathematics, computer science, and signal processing, play a key role in answering the modern challenges in data science.
R\'esum\'e
Les travaux de Joseph Fourier se sont av\'er\'es extr\^emement f\'econds, et la transform\'ee portant son nom est, aujourd'hui encore, incontournable. La souplesse de cette analyse, son efficacit\'e calculatoire et l'interpr\'etation physique qu'elle offre la met au c\oe ur de nombreux domaines scientifiques. Avec l'explosion du nombre et de la diversit\'e des donn\'ees num\'eriques, la g\'en\'eralisation des outils d'analyse s'appuyant sur la transformation de Fourier est plus que jamais n\'ecessaire. C'est en particulier le cas en science des donn\'ees, et sp\'ecifiquement en science des r\'eseaux. De nouveaux probl\`emes se posent quant \`a l'extraction d'information \`a partir de donn\'ees qui ont des structures irr\'eguli\`eres, comme des r\'eseaux sociaux, biologiques ou autres donn\'ees sur des graphes potentiellement arbitraires. Le traitement du signal sur graphe est une des directions prometteuses d\'edi\'ees \`a ce type de donn\'ees. Ce texte pr\'esente un \'etat de l'art du domaine, en se concentrant d'abord sur la fa\c{c}on de d\'efinir une transform\'ee de Fourier pour des donn\'ees sur graphes, comment l'interpr\'eter et enfin comment l'utiliser pour \'etudier ces donn\'ees. Il se termine par une discussion sur de possibles utilisations. Ce faisant, ce travail illustre en quoi la d\'emarche de Fourier reste moderne et universelle et montre comment ses id\'ees, essentiellement issues de la physique, puis enrichies par les math\'ematiques, l'informatique et la th\'eorie du signal, demeurent essentielles pour r\'epondre aux d\'efis actuels en science des donn\'ees.},

Although there are two ways to perform this construction -- vertices for the complex are either the rows or the columns of the matrix representing the relation -- the two constructions are homotopy equivalent. This article shows that the construction of a Dowker complex from a relation is a non-faithful covariant functor. Furthermore, we show that this functor can be made faithful by enriching the construction into a cosheaf on the Dowker complex. The cosheaf can be summarized by an integer weight function on the Dowker complex that is a complete isomorphism invariant for the relation. The cosheaf representation of a relation actually embodies both Dowker complexes, and we construct a duality functor that exchanges the two complexes. Finally, we explore a different cosheaf that detects the failure of the Dowker complex itself to be a faithful functor.},

We interpret such datasets as signals on graphs, introduce the concept of graph filters for processing such signals, and discuss important properties of graph filters, including linearity, shiftinvariance, and invertibility. We then demonstrate the application of graph filters to data classification by demonstrating that a classifier can be interpreted as an adaptive graph filter.

However, distributed algorithms are typically iterative and they suffer from convergence time and energy consumption. In this paper, we show that introducing appropriate asymmetric interaction mechanisms, with time-varying weights on each edge, it is possible to provide a substantial increase of convergence rate with respect to the symmetric time-invariant case. The basic idea underlying our approach comes from modeling the average consensus algorithm as an advection-diffusion process governing the homogenization of fluid mixtures. Exploiting such a conceptual link, we show how introducing interaction mechanisms among nearby nodes, mimicking suitable advection processes, yields a substantial increase of convergence rate. Moreover, we show that the homogenization enhancement induced by the advection term produces a qualitatively different scaling law of the convergence rate versus the network size with respect to the symmetric case.},

  abstract = {Modeling complex systems and data with graphs has been a mainstay of the applied mathematics community. The nodes in the graph represent entities and the edges model the relations between them. Simplicial complexes, a mathematical object common in topological data analysis, have emerged as a model for multi-nodal interactions that occur in several complex systems; for example, biological interactions occur between a set of molecules rather than just two, and communication systems can have group messages and not just person-to-person messages. While simplicial complexes can model multi-nodal interactions, many ideas from network analysis concerning dynamical processes lack a proper correspondence in the a simplicial complex model. In particular, diffusion processes and random walks, which underpin large parts of the network analysis toolbox including centrality measures and ranking, community detection, and contagion models, have so far been only scarcely studied for simplicial complexes. Here we develop a diffusion process on simplicial com- plexes that can serve as a foundation for making simplicial complex models more effective. Our key idea is to generalize the well-known relationship between the normalized graph Laplacian operator and random walks on graphs by devising an appropriate normalization for the Hodge Laplacian, the analog of the graph Laplacian for simplicial complexes. We demonstrate how our diffusion process can be used for system analysis by developing a generalization of PageRank for edges in simplicial complexes and analyzing a book co-purchasing dataset.},

Our key idea is to generalize the relationship between the normalized graph Laplacian and random walks on graphs by devising an appropriate normalization for the Hodge Laplacian, the analog of the graph Laplacian for simplicial complexes. We further discuss how this Hodge Laplacian gives rise to the Hodge decomposition, a decomposition of edge flows into intuitively interpretable components that are analogous to notions such as gradient flows or rotational flows from vector calculus. We leverage these results for data analytics that extract information about the edge-space of a simplicial complex. To illustrate the utility of these tools we derive spectral embeddings based on the Hodge Laplacian to examine trajectory data, and exemplify our ideas by an analysis of ocean drifters near Madagascar. We also present a generalization of personalized PageRank for the edge-space of simplicial complexes and apply it for the analysis of a book co-purchasing dataset.},

We describe four algebraic techniques which are useful in the study of splines: homology, graded algebra, localization, and inverse systems. Our goal is to give a hands-on introduction to the methods, and illustrate them with concrete examples in the context of splines. We highlight progress made with these methods, such as a formula for the third coefficient of the polynomial giving the dimension of the spline space in high degree, much of which builds on pioneering work of Schumaker, Alfeld-Schumaker, and Billera.

In this context, the goal is to characterize the relations between the different modalities by studying their underlying manifolds. We propose two new diffusion operators that allow to isolate, enhance and attenuate the hidden components of multi-modal data in a data-driven manner. Based on these new operators, efficient low-dimensional representations can be constructed for such data, which characterize the common structures and the differences between the manifolds underlying the different modalities. The capabilities of the proposed operators are demonstrated on 3D shapes and on a fetal heart rate monitoring application.},

Opinion dynamics is one of the processes studied, since opinions are the drivers of human behaviour, and play a crucial role in many global challenges that our complex world and societies are facing: global financial crises, global pandemics, growth of cities, urbanisation and migration patterns, and last but not least important, climate change and environmental sustainability and protection. Opinion formation is a complex process affected by the interplay of different elements, including the individual predisposition, the influence of positive and negative peer interaction (social networks playing a crucial role in this respect), the information each individual is exposed to, and many others. Several models inspired from those in use in physics have been developed to encompass many of these elements, and to allow for the identification of the mechanisms involved in the opinion formation process and the understanding of their role, with the practical aim of simulating opinion formation and spreading under various conditions. These modelling schemes range from binary simple models such as the voter model, to multi-dimensional continuous approaches. Here, we provide a review of recent methods, focusing on models employing both peer interaction and external information, and emphasising the role that less studied mechanisms, such as disagreement, has in driving the opinion dynamics.

The development of new courses is a natural consequence of a high level of excitement on the research frontier as newer techniques, such as numerical and symbolic computer systems, dynamical systems, and chaos, mix with and rein\- force the traditional methods of applied mathematics. Thus, the purpose of this textbook series is to meet the current and future needs of these advances and to encourage the teaching of new courses. TAM will publish textbooks suitable for use in advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses, and will complement the Applied Mathematics Sci\- ences (AMS) series, which will focus on advanced textbooks and research-level monographs. v Preface to the Second Edition The most significant differences between this edition and the first are as follows: \textbullet{} Additional chapters and sections have been written, dealing with: nonlinear controllability via Lie-algebraic methods, variational and numerical approaches to nonlinear control, including a brief introduction to the Calculus of Variations and the Minimum Principle, - time-optimal control of linear systems, feedback linearization (single-input case), nonlinear optimal feedback, controllability of recurrent nets, and controllability of linear systems with bounded controls.},

  abstract = {We present a nearly linear time algorithm that produces high-quality spectral sparsifiers of weighted graphs. Given as input a weighted graph \$G=(V,E,w)\$ and a parameter \$\textbackslash epsilon{$>$}0\$, we produce a weighted subgraph \$H=(V,\textbackslash tilde\{E\},\textbackslash tilde\{w\})\$ of G such that \$|\textbackslash tilde\{E\}|=O(n\textbackslash log n/\textbackslash epsilon\^2)\$ and all \$x\textbackslash in\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^V\$ satisfy \$(1-\textbackslash epsilon)\textbackslash sum\_\{uv\textbackslash in E\}\textbackslash,(x(u)-x(v))\^2w\_\{uv\}\textbackslash leq\textbackslash sum\_\{uv\textbackslash in\textbackslash tilde\{E\}\}\textbackslash,(x(u)-x(v))\^2\textbackslash tilde\{w\}\_\{uv\}\textbackslash leq(1+\textbackslash epsilon)\textbackslash sum\_\{uv\textbackslash in E\}\textbackslash,(x(u)-x(v))\^2w\_\{uv\}\$. This improves upon the spectral sparsifiers constructed by Spielman and Teng, which had \$O(n\textbackslash log\^\{c\}n)\$ edges for some large constant c, and upon the cut sparsifiers of Bencz\'ur and Karger, which only satisfied these inequalities for \$x\textbackslash in\textbackslash\{0,1\textbackslash\}\^V\$. A key ingredient in our algorithm is a subroutine of independent interest: a nearly linear time algorithm that builds a data structure from which we can query the approximate effective resistance between any two vertices in a graph in \$O(\textbackslash log n)\$ time.},

By examining the topology of small regions around each point, one can optimally stratify a given dataset into clusters, each of which is in turn well-approximable by a suitable submanifold of the ambient space. Since these approximating submanifolds might have different dimensions, we are able to detect non-manifold like singular regions in data even when none of the data points have been sampled from those singularities. We showcase this method by identifying the intersection of two surfaces in the 24-dimensional space of cyclo-octane conformations, and by locating all the self-intersections of a Henneberg minimal surface immersed in 3-dimensional space. Due to the local nature of the required topological computations, the algorithmic burden of performing such data stratification is readily distributable across several processors.},

The proposed initialization set is proved to be largest among all currently known sets. Then, the necessary and sufficient convergence condition of beliefs in damped Gaussian BP is developed, with the allowable range of damping factor explicitly established. The results theoretically confirm the extensively reported conjecture that damping is helpful to improve the convergence of Gaussian BP. Under totally asynchronous scheduling, a sufficient convergence condition of beliefs is also derived for the same proposed initialization set. Relationships between the proposed convergence conditions and existing ones are established analytically. At last, numerical examples are presented to corroborate the established theories.},

ETFs have applications in communications, coding theory, and sparse approximation. Numerical experiments indicate that ETFs arise for very few pairs (d, N), and it is an important challenge to develop restrictions on the pairs for which they can exist. This article uses field theory to provide detailed conditions on real and complex ETFs. In particular, it describes restrictions on harmonic ETFs, a specific type of complex ETF that appears in applications. Finally, the article offers empirical evidence that these conditions are sharp or nearly sharp, especially in the real case.},

Our approach is based on computation of homologies of the Rips complex corresponding to the sensor network. First, we present a decentralized scheme based on Laplacian flows to compute a generator of the first homology, which represents coverage holes. Then, we formulate the problem of localizing coverage holes as an optimization problem for computing a sparse generator of the first homology. Furthermore, we show that one can detect redundancies in the sensor network by finding a sparse generator of the second homology of the cover relative to its boundary. We demonstrate how subgradient methods can be used in solving these optimization problems in a distributed manner. Finally, we provide simulations that illustrate the performance of our algorithms.},

In this control scheme the topology of the control interconnections is fixed and time invariant. The control policy ensures that all agents eventually align with each other and have a common heading direction while at the same time avoid collisions and group into a tight formation.},

After showing that the performance of signal recovery algorithms is significantly affected by the location of samples, we suggest and compare a few alternative sampling strategies.

  abstract = {Machine learning with deep neural networks ("deep learning") allows for learning complex features directly from raw input data, completely eliminating hand-crafted, "hard-coded" feature extraction from the learning pipeline. This has lead to state-of-the-art performance being achieved across several---previously disconnected---problem domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning and generative modelling. These success stories nearly universally go hand-in-hand with availability of immense quantities of labelled training examples ("big data") exhibiting simple grid-like structure (e.g. text or images), exploitable through convolutional or recurrent layers. This is due to the extremely large number of degrees-of-freedom in neural networks, leaving their generalisation ability vulnerable to effects such as overfitting.

However, there remain many domains where extensive data gathering is not always appropriate, affordable, or even feasible. Furthermore, data is generally organised in more complicated kinds of structure---which most existing approaches would simply discard. Examples of such tasks are abundant in the biomedical space; with e.g. small numbers of subjects available for any given clinical study, or relationships between proteins specified via interaction networks. I hypothesise that, if deep learning is to reach its full potential in such environments, we need to reconsider "hard-coded" approaches---integrating assumptions about inherent structure in the input data directly into our architectures and learning algorithms, through structural inductive biases. In this dissertation, I directly validate this hypothesis by developing three structure-infused neural network architectures (operating on sparse multimodal and graph-structured data), and a structure-informed learning algorithm for graph neural networks, demonstrating significant outperformance of conventional baseline models and algorithms.},

To this end, we redefine information structures, as categories of random variables related by a notion of extension or refinement; classical and quantum probability spaces appear as models (or representations) of them. These generalized information structures form a category with finite products and coproducts. Information cohomology is a derived functor in the abelian category of modules over an algebra of random variables, a subcategory of the presheaf topos associated with the information structure. The cohomology is invariant under isomorphisms of generalized structures. We prove that the relatively free bar construction gives a projective object for the computation of this invariant. We provide detailed computations of \$H\^0\$ and \$H\^1\$ when the coefficients are functionals of classical probabilities, including the degenerate cases. In the process, we also establish the homological nature of Tsallis entropies, as the only cocycles in degree one for certain one-parameter family of modules.},

An important class of instances that arise in practice has the form Lx = b, where L is the Laplacian of an undirected graph. After decades of sustained research and combining tools from disparate areas, we now have Laplacian solvers that run in time nearlylinear in the sparsity (that is, the number of edges in the associated graph) of the system, which is a distant goal for general systems. Surprisingly, and perhaps not the original motivation behind this line of research, Laplacian solvers are impacting the theory of fast algorithms for fundamental graph problems. In this monograph, the emerging paradigm of employing Laplacian solvers to design novel fast algorithms for graph problems is illustrated through a small but carefully chosen set of examples. A part of this monograph is also dedicated to developing the ideas that go into the construction of near-linear-time Laplacian solvers. An understanding of these methods, which marry techniques from linear algebra and graph theory, will not only enrich the tool-set of an algorithm designer but will also provide the ability to adapt these methods to design fast algorithms for other fundamental problems.},

In this work, we consider stochastic cost functions, where exact gradients are replaced by stochastic approximations and the resulting gradient noise persistently seeps into the dynamics of the algorithm. We establish that the diffusion algorithm continues to yield meaningful estimates in these more challenging, non-convex environments, in the sense that (a) despite the distributed implementation, restricted to local interactions, individual agents cluster in a small region around a common and well-defined vector, which will carry the interpretation of a network centroid, and (b) the network centroid inherits many properties of the centralized, stochastic gradient descent recursion, including the return of an O(\textmu )-mean-square-stationary point in at most O 1/\textmu 2 iterations.},

Our approach differentiates from the existing approach by local convex mixing and gradient searching in that we force the states of the model to the global optimal point by controlling the subgradient of the global optimal function. In this way, the model we proposed does not suffer from the limitation of diminishing step size in gradient searching and allows fast asymptotic convergence. The model also shows robustness to additive noise, which is a main curse for algorithms based on convex mixing or consensus.},

  abstract = {Joint segmentation of image sets has great importance for object recognition, image classification, and image retrieval. In this paper, we aim to jointly segment a set of images starting from a small number of labeled images or none at all. To allow the images to share segmentation information with each other, we build a network that contains segmented as well as unsegmented images, and extract functional maps between connected image pairs based on image appearance features. These functional maps act as general property transporters between the images and, in particular, are used to transfer segmentations. We define and operate in a reduced functional space optimized so that the functional maps approximately satisfy cycle-consistency under composition in the network. A joint optimization framework is proposed to simultaneously generate all segmentation functions over the images so that they both align with local segmentation cues in each particular image, and agree with each other under network transportation. This formulation allows us to extract segmentations even with no training data, but can also exploit such data when available. The collective effect of the joint processing using functional maps leads to accurate information sharing among images and yields superior segmentation results, as shown on the iCoseg, MSRC, and PASCAL data sets.},

  abstract = {Persistent homology is constrained to purely topological persistence while multiscale graphs account only for geometric information. This work introduces persistent spectral theory to create a unified low-dimensional multiscale paradigm for revealing topological persistence and extracting geometric shape from high-dimensional datasets. For a point-cloud dataset, a filtration procedure is used to generate a sequence of chain complexes and associated families of simplicial complexes and chains, from which we construct persistent combinatorial Laplacian matrices. We show that a full set of topological persistence can be completely recovered from the harmonic persistent spectra, i.e., the spectra that have zero eigenvalues, of the persistent combinatorial Laplacian matrices. However, non-harmonic spectra of the Laplacian matrices induced by the filtration offer another power tool for data analysis, modeling, and prediction. In this work, non-harmonic persistent spectra are successfully devised to analyze the structure and stability of fullerenes and predict the B-factors of a protein, which cannot be straightforwardly extracted from the current persistent homology. Extensive numerical experiments indicate the tremendous potential of the proposed persistent spectral analysis in data science.},

The central notion is the behavior, which consists of the set of time trajectories that are declared possible by the model of a dynamical system. Often, the behavior is defined as the set of solutions of a system of differential equations. Models that specify a behavior usually involve latent variables in addition to the manifest variables the model aims at. We have also described a methodology for modeling interconnected systems, called tearing, zooming, and linking. The underlying mathematical language consists of terminals, modules, the interconnection graph, the module embedding, and the manifest variable assignment. The combination of module equations, interconnection constraints, and manifest variable assignment leads to a latent-variable representation for the behavior of the manifest variables the model aims. This methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking offers a systematic procedure for modeling interconnected systems that is much better adapted to the physics of interconnected systems than input/output-modeling procedures such as, for example, Simulink. The methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking has many things in common with bond graphs.},

In this context the notions of linearity, time invariance, and finite dimensionality will be introduced. It will be shown that a given family of time series may be represented by a system of (AR) equations: Riw(t + l) + Rl - 1w(t + l - 1) + \ldots{} + R0w(t) = 0, or, equivalently, by a finite dimensional linear time invariant system: x(t + 1) = Ax(t) + Bu(t); y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t); w = (u, y), if and only if this family is linear, shift invariant and complete (or, as is equivalent, closed in the topology of pointwise convergence). This yields a very high level and elegant set of axioms which characterize these familiar objects. It is emphasized, however, that no a priori choice is made as to which components of w are inputs and which are outputs. Such a separation always exists in any specific linear time invariant model. Starting from these definitions, the structural indices of such systems are introduced and it is shown how an (AR) representation of a system having a given behaviour can be constructed. These results will be used in a modelling context in Part II of the paper.},

However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of graph neural networks. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

These optimal linear iterations are often substantially faster than several common heuristics that are based on the Laplacian of the associated graph. We show how problem structure can be exploited to speed up interior-point methods for solving the fastest distributed linear iteration problem, for networks with up to a thousand or so edges. We also describe a simple subgradient method that handles far larger problems, with up to 100000 edges. We give several extensions and variations on the basic problem.},

The principle exhibits two scenarios of active sampling: Fisher information maximization that leads to unsupervised sampling based on a sequential maximization of graph algebraic connectivity without considering labels; and Bayesian information maximization that selects samples with the largest information gain from prior to posterior, which gives a supervised sampling involving the labels collected. Experiments show that the proposed methods boost the sampling efficiency as compared to traditional sampling schemes and are thus valuable to practical crowdsourcing experiments.},

We present novel approaches to problems in pursuit and evasion games and topological data analysis, where cellular sheaves and cosheaves are used to extract global information from data distributed with respect to time, boolean constraints, spatial location, and density. The main contribution of this dissertation lies in the enrichment of a fundamental tool in topological data analysis, called persistent homology, through cellular sheaf theory. We present a distributed computation mechanism of persistent homology using cellular cosheaves. Our construction is an extension of the generalized Mayer-Vietoris principle to filtered spaces obtained via a sequence of spectral sequences. We discuss a general framework in which the distribution scheme can be adapted according to a user-specific property of interest. The resulting persistent homology reflects properties of the topological features, allowing the user to perform refined data analysis. Finally, we apply our construction to perform a multi-scale analysis to detect features of varying sizes that are overlooked by standard persistent homology.},

The representation of G is unique up to change of gains when the gain graph is full, but not in general. The representation of G or L is unique or semi-unique (up to changing the gains) for `thick' biased graphs. The lift representations are unique (up to change of gains) for L0 but not for L. The bias matroid is representable also in other ways by points and hyperplanes; one of these representations dualizes the vector representation, while two, in projective space, strongly generalize the theorems of Menelaus and Ceva. (The latter specialize to properties of the geometry of midpoints and farpoints, and of median and edge-parallel hyperplanes, in an affine simplex.) The dual hyperplane representation can be abstracted away from fields to a kind of equational logic and permutation geometry that exist for every gain group. The lift matroids are representable by orthographic points and by linear, projective, and affinographic hyperplanes. L0 also has a metric hyperplanar representation that depends on the Pythagorean theorem. Incidental results are that Whitney's 2-isomorphism operations preserve gains and, to an extent, matroids; and new definitions of the bias and lift matroids based on extremal properties of the rank functions.},

  abstract = {A signed graph is a graph whose edges are labeled by signs. This is a bibliography of signed graphs and related mathematics.Several kinds of labelled graph have been called "signed" yet are mathematically very different. I distinguish four types:Group-signed graphs: the edge labels are elements of a 2-element group and are multiplied around a polygon (or along any walk). Among the natural generalizations are larger groups and vertex signs.Sign-colored graphs, in which the edges are labelled from a two-element set that is acted upon by the sign group: - interchanges labels, + leaves them unchanged. This is the kind of "signed graph" found in knot theory. The natural generalization is to more colors and more general groups \textemdash ~or no group.Weighted graphs, in which the edge labels are the elements +1 and -1 of the integers or another additive domain. Weights behave like numbers, not signs; thus I regard work on weighted graphs as outside the scope of the bibliography \textemdash{} except (to some extent) when the author calls the weights "signs".Labelled graphs where the labels have no structure or properties but are called "signs" for any or no reason.},

The definiteness of the weighted Laplacian is studied in terms of certain matrices that are related via congruent and similarity transformations. For a graph with a single negative weight edge, we show that the weighted Laplacian becomes indefinite if the magnitude of the negative weight is less than the inverse of the effective resistance between the two incident nodes. This result is extended to multiple negative weight edges. The utility of these results are demonstrated in a weighted consensus network where appropriately placed negative weight edges can induce a clustering behavior for the protocol.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has been shown to be successful in a number of domains, ranging from acoustics, images, to natural language processing. However, applying deep learning to the ubiquitous graph data is non-trivial because of the unique characteristics of graphs. Recently, substantial research efforts have been devoted to applying deep learning methods to graphs, resulting in beneficial advances in graph analysis techniques. In this survey, we comprehensively review the different types of deep learning methods on graphs. We divide the existing methods into five categories based on their model architectures and training strategies: graph recurrent neural networks, graph convolutional networks, graph autoencoders, graph reinforcement learning, and graph adversarial methods. We then provide a comprehensive overview of these methods in a systematic manner mainly by following their development history. We also analyze the differences and compositions of different methods. Finally, we briefly outline the applications in which they have been used and discuss potential future research directions.},

We consider vectorized versions of PageRank and effective resistance that can be used as basic tools for organizing and analyzing complex data sets. For example, generalized PageRank and effective resistance can be utilized to derive and modify diffusion distances for vector diffusion maps in data and image processing. Furthermore, the edge-ranking of the connection graphs determined by vectorized PageRank and effective resistance are an essential part of sparsification algorithms that simplify and preserve the global structure of connection graphs. In addition, we examine consistencies in a connection graph, particularly in the applications of recovering low-dimensional data sets and the reduction of noise. In these applications, we analyze the effect of deleting edges with high edge rank.},

The objective is to control the translation and scale of the formation while maintaining the desired formation pattern. Unlike conventional approaches where the target formation is defined by relative positions or distances, we propose a novel bearing-based approach where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor bearings. Since the bearings are invariant to the translation and scale of the formation, the bearing-based approach provides a simple solution to the problem of translational and scaling formation maneuver control. Linear formation control laws for double-integrator dynamics are proposed and the global formation stability is analyzed. This paper also studies bearing-based formation control in the presence of practical problems, including input disturbances, acceleration saturation, and collision avoidance. The theoretical results are illustrated with numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics system, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difficult to train for a fixed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

Each arc (i,j) of T has a weight Wi,j which is an mi\texttimes mj matrix. For two vertices i,j {$\in$} [n], let the unique directed path from i to j be Pi,j=x0,x1,...,xd where d {$\geq$} 1, x0=i and xd=j. Define the product distance from i to j to be the mi\texttimes mj matrix Mi,j=Wx0,x1Wx1,x2{$\cdots$}Wxd-1,xd. Let N={$\Sigma$}i=1 nmi. The N\texttimes N product distance matrix D of T is a partitioned matrix whose (i,j)-block is the matrix Mi,j. We give a formula for det(D). When det(D){$\neq$}0, the inverse of D is also obtained. These generalize known results for the product distance matrix when either the weights are real numbers, or m1=m2={$\cdots$}=mn=s and the weights Wi,j=Wj,i=We for each edge e=\{i,j\} {$\in$} E(T). \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier Inc.
